            <h3>Classic French Apple Cake</h3>
            <p>A simple and easy rum-flavored cake nestled with big chunks of apples.</p>

            <h3>So what makes it a French Apple Cake?</h3>
           <p> Unlike in US/Canada, a French Apple Cake doesn’t call for any spices like cinnamon or nutmeg, nor a crumble top, nuts or glaze. The fame of this French cake rather relies on its simple crumb made from a generous amount of butter and flavored with dark rum, making it incredibly fragrant. In texture, it is reminiscent of the German Versunkener Apfelken or the Russian Sharlotka, both made in similar ways, with more fruit than actual cake dough – but really, I think the buttery crumb and dark rum truly makes the difference here.</p>

            <h3>Choose the Right Apples</h3>
            <p>The recipe begins by choosing the right apples.  And for this Classic French Apple Cake, or most apple cakes really, choose baking apples . Compared to eating apples, baking apples aren’t as juicy and won’t turn mushy once baked. Good baking varieties I recommend are (in US/Canada):</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>This cake requires 2 large or 3 small apples. The recipe is pretty forgiving and the result won’t be impacted if you use a little less or more apple. You can opt for one single variety or a mix. For instance, you can combine tart and tangy Granny Smith apples with sweet Honey Crisp apples for a nice balance of textures and flavors.</p>

            <h3>My Cooking tips:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Choose baking apples, such as Fiji, Honeycrisp, Mutsu, Jonagold or Braeburn. You can opt for one variety, or mix it up so you can have different textures (soft or crunchy) and tastes (sweet and tart).</li>
                <li>I like to peel the apples, but you can certainly leave them unpeeled if you wish. </li>
                <li>If you don’t have dark rum on hand, you can substitute for Cognac. For a non-alcoholic version, you can substitute the rum for apple juice; although I really recommend you use rum or Cognac – it truly makes the cake!</li>
                <li>The cake is rather delicate in texture, so I recommend using a well-greased springform pan so it is easier to remove it from the pan (flipping it onto a plate may break it). This recipe works in a 8″ or 9″ circular pan. </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>How to store this French Apple Cake?</h3>
            <p>This cake can keep for up to three days in the fridge, covered. Note that the sugar crackly top will soften after a day, and may get wet/stuck if covered with plastic film. Instead, I recommend covering the cake with a cake dome or any large bowl that won’t touch the top of the cake. </p>
