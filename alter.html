            <h3>Helpful Swaps</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Pie dough: Pie dough is an excellent alternative to puff pastry in this recipe.</li>
                <li>Mini baked brie: For 1-ounce mini brie wheels, cut the puff pastry into six 3×3-inch squares, wrap each brie, then bake at 400°F for 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
            </ul>
                
                
            <h3>Make-Ahead, Freezing, and Reheating Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Make ahead: The brie can be wrapped in pastry and kept refrigerated for up to a day before baking and serving. Brush with egg wash just before baking.</li>
                <li>To freeze: You can wrap the brie in pastry (hold off on the egg wash), wrap it tightly in plastic wrap, and freeze. When you’re ready to bake, unwrap it, brush with egg wash, and bake directly from frozen. You may need to bake for a few extra minutes for the cheese to fully soften.</li>
                <li>To reheat: Baked brie tastes and looks best right after it’s been baked, but you can reheat it in a 200°F oven until the cheese is warm.</li>

            </ul>
           <h3>Baked Brie Variations</h3>
           <ul>
                <li> Jam or preserves: Top with a few spoonfuls jam or preserves, like raspberry jam, apricot jam, or jalapeño jelly.</li>
                <li>Honey and nuts: Top with a few spoonfuls of honey and toasted, chopped nuts especially walnuts or pecans.</li>
                <li>Chutney: Spoon your favorite fruit chutney on top, like mango chutney or cranberry-cherry chutney.</li>
                <li>Cranberry sauce: Top with a few spoonfuls of store-bought or homemade cranberry sauce.</li>
                <li>Caramelized apples: With a sweet, caramel-like flavor and a hint of cinnamon, these caramelized apples will remind you of apple pie filling. Scoop them on top of the brie.</li>
                <li>Caramelized onions: Slowly caramelize onions over low heat until very brown, soft, and sweet. You can stir in a few teaspoons of brown sugar or balsamic vinegar if you like. Scoop over the brie.</li>
                <li>       Caramelized onions and mushrooms: Caramelize onions and add chopped or sliced mushrooms in the last half of cooking.</li>
            </ul>
